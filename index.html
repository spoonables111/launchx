            <p class="reg-text">
            Replacing plastic with food could help humankind to save the enivronment.

By now, you may have gotten used to using plastic spoons to scoop up your food. After all, they are cheap, and can easily be thrown away after you have finished snacking. But when they are thrown away, they add to an increasingly worrying amount of plastic waste that stays in the environment, never to leave. We could just hold onto the spoons, but that would ruin the point of them being disposable. Yet, we should not just leave them to harm our world.

But what if there was an alternative to the plastic spoons? An alternative that would not pollute the environment, but still remain convenient? That still remains cheap and dependable? Perhaps, it could be simply eaten like a cookie, after being used?

This alternative, is the Spoonable.</p>
